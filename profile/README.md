# IEEE: Computer Society at EWU

Welcome to the IEEE: Computer Society Club at Eastern Washington University! We are a student chapter of the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society](^www.computer.org^), the world's leading organization of computing professionals. Our mission is to empower and equip students with the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to become proficient developers and excel in their pursuit of MANG (Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and other top-tier technology industry jobs. We strive to create a dynamic and inclusive community where students can network, learn from each other, and gain exposure to cutting-edge technologies and industry best practices.

## What we do

We organize various events and activities throughout the year, such as:

- Workshops and tutorials on topics such as web development, data structures and algorithms, machine learning, cloud computing, and more.
- Hackathons and coding competitions where students can showcase their creativity and problem-solving skills, and win prizes and recognition.
- Guest lectures and panel discussions with industry experts and alumni who share their insights and experiences in the tech field.
- Social events and fun games where students can relax and have fun with their peers and mentors.
